            <p class="color">The worst floods in Bangladesh in nearly two decades has submerged 70 percent of Sylhet
                and
                60 percent of
                the neighbouring Sunamganj districts, leaving at least 10 people dead and more than two million
                stranded, officials said.<br>Thousands are now facing shortages of food and other essential items.
                The
                flooding has got worse in the last three days. We urge you all to come forward and help the needy
                people
                in providing essential provisions to survive.</p>
